Layout Standards

Device Control Standards
Graphical user interface device control consistency is of the utmost importance. As an example, the play button for
the DVD transport controls page should be in the exact same place with the same exact orientation as the play button
for the DVR. Users must be able to quickly identify a button and its capabilities without relearning the function for each
new device control encountered.

Extron has developed the following standards for environmental and device control layouts: they are applied to all of
our templates. We believe if these unified standards were implemented by the AV industry, the resulting consistency
would make touchpanel control less intimidating to the user.
